# life2
here are some screenshots. the first one is the splash screen for a particular user, which gives a sort of heat map of correspondences grouped by month:

and this is what happens when you click "may 2000" for example:

notice the links to the messages show the senders and recipients by name, not email address or facebook handle -- that's because the names of actual people have been mapped to all the accounts they've had, at least for a lot of accounts (gets to be diminishing returns after a while, as you can probably imagine), which makes using the app a whole lot nicer. you can click any of those links the message will appear overlaid so that you can read it (i won't show that though because it may be sensitive info !), then close it with another click to return the to the grid and keep exploring.
