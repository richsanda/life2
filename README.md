here are some screenshots. the first one is the splash screen for a particular user, which gives a sort of heat map of correspondences grouped by month:

and this is what happens when you click "may 2000" for example:

then you can click the links below and an overlay of the message appears that you can read and close with a click. i won't show that though because it may be sensitive info !
